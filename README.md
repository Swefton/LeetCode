- [Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](2871-double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list)
   - **Description:** Given a number where each digit is represented by a node in a singly linked list, double the number.
   - **Solution:** This problem is best solved when the deepest node is processed first, to do so I decided I require a stack. To optimize memory I decided to use a recursive solution so no new memory is allocated to creating a stack.
   - PS: This is my friend's solution bellow, I think it's pretty cool how [they](https://github.com/spaceybread) manipulated a [vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10735) in Python for his solve
   ```python
      class Solution:
        def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
           import sys
           sys.set_int_max_str_digits(0)
           build = head.val
           node = head
           while node.next != None:
               node = node.next
               build = build*10 + node.val
               
           build = str(build << 1)
           newHead = ListNode(int(build[0]))
           curr = newHead
           for i in range(1, len(build)):
               curr.next = ListNode(int(build[i]))
               curr = curr.next
           
           return newHead
     ```
