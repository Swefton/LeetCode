- **Problem 1:** [Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](2871-double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list)
   - **Description:** Given a number where each digit is represented by a node in a singly linked list, double the number.
   - **Solution:** This problem is best solved when the deepest node is processed first, to do so I decided I require a stack. To optimize memory I decided to use a recursive solution so no new memory is allocated to creating a stack.
